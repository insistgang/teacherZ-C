# Cryptography as a Service Security Pattern

In this pattern, the management of cryptographic keys is delegated to the same entity that performs the cryptographic actions. Consequently, the system under design **never possesses the used cryptographic keys**.

## Benefits and Trade-offs

**Benefits:**
- Limits risk of leaking cryptographic keys
- Reduces risk of incorrectly configuring and/or using a cipher
- System only handles key identifiers, not key material

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires greater trust in the entity providing cryptographic operations
- Dependency on external service availability

## Common Implementations

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Cloud-based KMS** | Google Cloud KMS, Amazon KMS, Azure Key Vault |
| **Mobile Platform** | Android Keystore, iOS KeyChain |
| **Hardware** | Hardware Security Modules (HSM) |

## Core Components

| Role | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **System** | Entity | Wants to perform cryptographic operations |
| **Cryptography Service** | Entity | Handles cryptographic operations, key storage, and key management |

**Note:** The Cryptography Service inherits the Cryptographer role from the parent Cryptographic Key Management pattern.

### Data Elements

- **keyConf**: Configuration for key generation (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric, key length) - optional
- **keyId**: Identifier returned by the service to reference the generated key
- **input**: Plaintext input for cryptographic action
- **output**: Result of cryptographic action (e.g., ciphertext, signature)
- **config**: Configuration for the cryptographic operation (e.g., cipher mode) - optional
- **masterKey**: Credential used to authenticate the System to the Cryptography Service

### Actions

- **generate_key**: Generate new cryptographic key according to configuration
- **crypto_action**: Perform cryptographic operation using the identified key

## Pattern Flow

### Key Generation
```
System → [generate_key(keyConf)] → Cryptography Service
Cryptography Service → [keyId] → System
```

The System requests key generation with optional configuration. The Cryptography Service generates the key internally and returns only an **identifier** (not the key material) for future operations.

### Cryptographic Action
```
System → [crypto_action(input, keyId, config)] → Cryptography Service
Cryptography Service → [output] → System
```

To use a previously generated key, the System provides the keyId received during generation. The key material never leaves the Cryptography Service.

## Key Difference from Self-Managed Cryptography

| Aspect | Cryptography as a Service | Self-Managed Cryptography |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Key possession | System holds only key identifiers | System holds actual key material |
| Key storage | Managed by service | Managed by application |
| Key exposure risk | Lower (keys never exposed) | Higher (keys in application memory) |
| Trust requirement | Trust the service provider | Trust your own implementation |

## Security Considerations

### The Cryptography Service as Uncontrolled Entity

The Cryptography Service should be considered an **uncontrolled entity**, requiring additional measures to secure interactions.

### Cloud-based Services (Google Cloud KMS, Amazon KMS)

When using cloud-based cryptographic services:
- All interactions travel via the **public Internet**
- **Confidentiality and integrity** of exchanged messages must be ensured
- **Authentication** is critical—verify you're interacting with the actual service, not an attacker spoofing it
- Use TLS/HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper service authentication (API keys, certificates, IAM)

### Mobile Platform Services (Android Keystore, iOS KeyChain)

When using platform-provided services:
- Service is a **local entity** provided by the underlying platform
- Communication channel is typically more controlled
- Still verify platform-specific security guarantees
- Consider device compromise scenarios

### Communication Channel Security

As the Cryptography Service is an uncontrolled entity, at least part of the communication channel will also be uncontrolled.

**Required protections:**
- Confidentiality of requests (especially for encryption/decryption operations)
- Integrity of requests and responses
- Authentication of the service endpoint

### Master Key Handling

The **master key** is used as a credential to authenticate the System to the Cryptography Service.

**Critical:** The master key should be treated as a credential:
- Store securely (environment variables, secrets manager)
- Never hardcode in source code
- Rotate periodically
- Limit access to minimal required principals

### Key Identifier (keyId) Protection

While keyId is not the key material itself:
- Protect against unauthorized tampering during storage
- An attacker who can modify keyId might redirect operations to a different key
- Consider encrypting or signing stored key identifiers

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Selected appropriate Cryptography Service for your use case
- [ ] Reviewed service documentation for security guarantees
- [ ] Secured communication channel (TLS, certificate validation)
- [ ] Master key stored and managed as a credential
- [ ] Key identifiers protected from tampering
- [ ] Service authentication properly configured
- [ ] Considered service availability and failure modes
- [ ] Implemented proper error handling for service failures
- [ ] Documented which keys are used for which purposes

## Service Selection Considerations

| Consideration | Cloud KMS | Platform Keystore | HSM |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Network dependency | Required | No | Varies |
| Audit logging | Built-in | Limited | Built-in |
| Regulatory compliance | Varies by provider | Platform-dependent | Often required |
| Key ceremony | Managed | N/A | Often required |
| Multi-cloud support | Provider-specific | Platform-specific | Usually portable |

## Consult Service Documentation

**Always consult the documentation** of candidate Cryptography Service(s) to assess:
- Security guarantees for interactions between your system and the service
- Key protection mechanisms (hardware backing, encryption at rest)
- Audit and compliance capabilities
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Key backup and disaster recovery procedures

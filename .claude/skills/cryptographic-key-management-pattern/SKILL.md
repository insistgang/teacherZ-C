# Cryptographic Key Management Security Pattern

When integrating cryptographic primitives into a system, correctly managing cryptographic keys is a crucial aspect. This pattern encapsulates common issues when applying solutions involving cryptography.

## Importance

**Proper key management is one of the most crucial aspects when applying cryptography.**

Any security guarantees provided by a cryptosystem can be nullified if an attacker can obtain or tamper with the used cryptographic key(s).

**Example**: An attacker that obtains a supposedly secret session key will be able to decrypt all messages encrypted with that key.

## Key Security Requirements

In most circumstances, cryptographic keys should be:
1. **Kept confidential** throughout their lifecycle
2. **Have their integrity protected** throughout their lifecycle

**Exception**: For some types of keys, such as the **public key** in an asymmetric key pair, the confidentiality requirement can be relaxed (but integrity must still be protected).

## Core Components

| Role | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Entity** | Entity | Wants to generate and use cryptographic keys |
| **Cryptographer** | Cryptographic Primitive | Library generating keys and performing cryptographic actions |

### Data Elements

- **keyConf**: Configuration for key generation (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric, key length) - optional
- **keyInfo**: Information on the key to use (identifier or key material itself, depending on implementation)
- **input**: Plaintext input for cryptographic action
- **output**: Result of cryptographic action (e.g., ciphertext, signature)
- **config**: Configuration for Cryptographer (e.g., cipher mode) - optional

### Actions

- **generate_key**: Generate new cryptographic key according to configuration
- **crypto_action**: Perform cryptographic action (e.g., encrypt, sign) using identified key

## Pattern Flow

### Key Generation
```
Entity → [generate_key(keyConf)] → Cryptographer
Cryptographer → [keyInfo] → Entity
```

The Entity requests key generation with optional configuration. The Cryptographer generates the key and returns information needed to use it in future requests.

### Cryptographic Action
```
Entity → [crypto_action(input, keyInfo, config)] → Cryptographer
Cryptographer → [output] → Entity
```

To use a previously generated key, Entity provides keyInfo received during generation along with input data and optional configuration.

## Security Considerations

### Key Configuration Protection (keyConf)

If key configuration is provided, it should be **protected from undetected tampering**:
- During transmission over uncontrolled channels
- During persistent storage by Entity

**Risk Example**: An attacker may change key configuration to generate a shorter key than advised, making ciphertexts easier to break.

### Key Information Protection (keyInfo)

After generating a key, Entity receives keyInfo which it will process and use in further interactions.

- **Protect against unauthorized tampering** during transmission and storage
- An attacker that can influence keyInfo might change the key used to one under their control
- **Example**: Attacker tampers with keyInfo so encryption uses a key the attacker knows, allowing decryption

The exact information and necessary security measures depend on the chosen implementation pattern.

### Configuration Protection (config)

If Entity provides action configuration to Cryptographer:
- Protect against undetected tampering during transmission and storage
- Attacker might change config to use insecure, deprecated ciphers

## Implementation Patterns

This pattern has two main implementations:

### 1. Cryptography as a Service
- Delegate key management to external service (e.g., KMS, HSM)
- System never possesses cryptographic keys directly
- Only stores key identifiers
- Reduces risk of key leakage
- Examples: AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS, Android Keystore

### 2. Self-Managed Cryptography
- Application manages keys itself
- Application responsible for key storage, distribution, revocation
- Requires careful attention to key confidentiality and integrity
- More control but more responsibility

## Key Lifecycle Considerations

Throughout a key's lifecycle, ensure:

| Phase | Confidentiality | Integrity |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Generation | Protect output | Protect configuration |
| Storage | Encrypt at rest | Detect tampering |
| Distribution | Secure channel | Verify authenticity |
| Usage | Limit exposure | Validate before use |
| Rotation | Secure transition | Complete replacement |
| Destruction | Secure deletion | Confirm destruction |

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Keys

| Key Type | Confidentiality | Integrity |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Symmetric key | **Required** | Required |
| Asymmetric private key | **Required** | Required |
| Asymmetric public key | Can be relaxed | **Required** |

**Note**: Even public keys require integrity protection—an attacker substituting a public key can compromise the entire system.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Key confidentiality protected (storage and transmission)
- [ ] Key integrity protected (storage and transmission)
- [ ] Key configuration protected from tampering
- [ ] KeyInfo protected from tampering
- [ ] Action configuration protected from tampering
- [ ] Key lifecycle managed (generation through destruction)
- [ ] Appropriate implementation chosen (as-a-service vs. self-managed)
- [ ] Public key integrity verified even if confidentiality relaxed

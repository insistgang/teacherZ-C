Introduction
Image segmentation aims to group objects in an image with similar characteristics
together. It is one of the fundamental tasks in image processing and computer vision,
having numerous engineering, medical, and commercial applications. It also serves
as a preliminary step for higher level computer vision tasks like object recognition
and interpretation. Most of the methods in literature face the following dilemmas:
(i) lack of ﬂexibility, applicability, and interpretability and (ii) difﬁcult to trade
off the efﬁciency and effectiveness. It is therefore not an easy task for users to
know which method could fulﬁll their needs. In this regard, the users are required
to make modiﬁcations here and there on existing methods accordingly, which is
however frustrating if the users are not familiar with segmentation technologies. It
is important to have a segmentation methodology which is simple to understand
and apply and, at the same time, fast and reliable. In this article, we introduce a
segmentation methodology – smoothing and thresholding (SaT) – which is able to
meet these challenges (Cai et al.2013b, 2017, 2019; Cai and Steidl2013; Chan et al.
2014).
The piecewise constant Mumford-Shah (PCMS) model (nonconvex, a special
case of the Mumford-Shah model (Mumford and Shah1989)) and the Rudin-Osher-
Fatemi (ROF) model (convex, Rudin et al. 1992) are two of the most famous
variational models in the research areas of image segmentation and restoration,
respectively. Note that image restoration intends to remove image degradations such
as noise, blur, or occlusions.
Let Ω ⊂ R
2 be a bounded, open set with Lipschitz boundary and f : Ω →
[0, 1] be a given (degraded) image. In 1989 Mumford and Shah proposed solving
segmentation problems by minimizing over Γ ⊂ Ω and u ∈ H 1(Ω \Γ) the energy
functional
EMS(u, Γ;Ω) = H 1(Γ )+ λ′
∫

|∇u|2dx + λ
∫

(1)
where H 1 denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure in R2. The functional
EMS contains three terms: the penalty term on the length of Γ ,t h eH 1 semi-norm
that enforces the smoothness of u in Ω \Γ , and the data ﬁdelity term controlling the

distance of u to the given imagef . Related approaches in a spatially discrete setting
were proposed in Blake and Zisserman ( 1987) and Geman and Geman ( 1984). An
early attempt to solve the challenging task of ﬁnding a minimizer of the nonconvex
and non-smooth Mumford-Shah functional (1) was done by approximating it using
a sequence of simpler elliptic problems; see Ambrosio and Tortorelli (1990)f o rt h e
so-called Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation. Many approaches to simplify model
(1) were meanwhile proposed in the literature, for example, in Pock et al. (2009b), a
convex relaxation of the model was suggested. Another important simpliﬁcation is
to restrict its solution to be piecewise constant, which leads to the so-called PCMS
model.
The PCMS model is based on the restriction ∇u = 0o n Ω \Γ , which results in

PCMS(u, Γ;Ω) = H 1(Γ )+ λ

(u − f) 2dx. (2)
Assuming that Ω = ⋃K−1
i=0 Ωi with pairwise disjoint setsΩi and constant functions
u(x) ≡ mi on Ωi , i = 0,...K − 1, model (2) can be rewritten as

where Ω := {Ωi}K−1
i=0 , m := {mi}K−1
i=0 , and Per(Ωi;Ω) denotes the perimeter of Ωi
in Ω . If the number of phases is two, i.e., K = 2, the PCMS model is the model of
the active contours without edges (Chan-Vese model) (Chan and Vese2001),
ECV(Ω 1,m 0,m 1) = Per(Ω 1;Ω) + λ

.

In Chan and Vese (2001), the authors proposed to solve (4), where it can easily get
stuck in local minima. To overcome this drawback, a convex relaxation approach
was proposed in Chan et al. ( 2006a). More precisely, it was shown that a global
minimizer of ECV(·,m 0,m 1) for ﬁxed m0,m 1 can be found by solving
¯u = arg min

TV( u )+ λ

, (5)
and setting Ω 1 := {x ∈ Ω :¯u(x) > ρ } for any choice of ρ ∈[ 0, 1); see also
Bellettini et al. ( 1991) and Bresson et al. ( 2007). Note that the ﬁrst term of ( 5)
is known as the total variation ( TV ) and the space BV is the space of functions
of bounded variation; see Section 2 for the deﬁnition. In other words, ( 5)i sa
tight relaxation of the Chan-Vese model with ﬁxed m0 and m1. For the convex
formulation of the full model (4), see Brown et al. (2012).
There are many other approaches for two-phase image segmentation based on
the Chan-Vese model and its convex version; see, e.g., Zhang et al. (2008), Bresson
et al. (2007), Dong et al. (2010), and Bauer et al. (2017). In particular, a hybrid level
1388 X. Cai et al.
set method was proposed in Zhang et al. ( 2008), which replaces the ﬁrst term of
(4) by a boundary feature map and the data ﬁdelity terms in ( 4) by the difference
between the given image f and a ﬁxed threshold chosen by a user or a specialist.
Method Zhang et al. ( 2008) was used in medical image segmentation. However,
since every time it needs the user to choose a proper threshold for its model, it is
not automatic and thus its applications are restricted. In Bresson et al. ( 2007), the
TV term of (5) was replaced by a weighted TV term which helps the new model
to capture much more important geometric properties. In Dong et al. ( 2010), the
TV term of ( 5) was replaced by a wavelet frame decomposition operator which,
similar to the model in Bresson et al. ( 2007), can also capture important geometric
properties. Nevertheless, for its solution u, no similar conclusions as the ones in
Chan et al. ( 2006a) can be addressed; that is, there is no theory to support that its
segmentation resultΩ 1 ={ x : u(x) > ρ} for ρ ∈[ 0, 1) is a solution as to some kind
of objective functional. In Bauer et al. ( 2017), the Chan-Vese model was extended
for 3D biopore segmentation in tomographic images.
In Vese and Chan ( 2002), Chan and Vese proposed a multiphase segmentation
model based on the PCMS model using level sets. However, this method can also
get stuck easily in local minima. Convex (non-tight) relaxation approaches for the
PCMS model were proposed, which are basically focusing on solving

which has been studied extensively in the literature; see, e.g., Chambolle ( 2005),
Chambolle et al. (2010), Chan et al. (2006b) and references therein.
A subtle connection between image segmentation and image restoration has been
raised in Cai et al. ( 2013b). In detail, a two-stage image segmentation method
is proposed – SaT method – which ﬁnds the solution of a convex variant of the
Mumford-Shah model in the ﬁrst stage, followed by a thresholding step in the
second one. The convex minimization functional in the ﬁrst stage (the smoothing
stage) is the ROF functional (7) plus an additional smoothing term
∫

Cai et al. (2019), a linkage between the PCMS and ROF models was shown, which
gives rise to a new image segmentation paradigm: manipulating image segmentation
through image restoration plus thresholding. This is also the essence of the SaT
segmentation methodology.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Firstly, the SaT segmen-
tation and its advantages are introduced. After that, more SaT-based methods and
applications are presented and demonstrated, followed by a brief conclusion.
SaT Methodology
The main procedures of the SaT segmentation methodology are ﬁrst smoothing
and then thresholding, where the smoothing step is executed by solving pertinent
convex objective functions (note that most of segmentation models in literature are
nonconvex and therefore much harder to handle compared to convex models) and
the thresholding step is just completed by thresholding the result from the smoothing
step using proper thresholds; see an instance given below.
The smoothing process in Cai et al. (2013b) is to solve the convex minimization
problem (cf. the non-smooth Mumford-Shah functional (1)):

where λ and μ are positive parameters andA is the blurring operator if the observed
image is blurred by A or the identity operator if there is no blurring. The minimizer
of (8) is a smoothed approximation off . The ﬁrst term in (8) is the data-ﬁtting term,
the second term ensures smoothness of the minimizer, and the third term ensures
regularity of the level sets of the minimizer. We emphasize that model ( 8) can be
minimized quickly by using currently available efﬁcient algorithms such as the split-
Bregman algorithm (Goldstein and Osher 2009) or the Chambolle-Pock method
(Chambolle and Pock 2011). After we have obtained g in (8), assume we are given
the thresholds
min{g}= ρ
0 <ρ 1 < ··· <ρK−1 <ρK = max{g}.
Then we threshold g by setting x ∈ Ω to be in the sub-domainΩi if ρi−1 ≤ g(x) <
ρi . The values{ρi}K−1
i=1 can be obtained by applying the K-means method, a popular
clustering method, on the intensity ofg, or they can be obtained by trial and error in
order to get a ﬁner segmentation.
Theorem 1. Let Ω be a bounded connected open subset of R2 with a Lipschitz
boundary. Let f ∈ L2(Ω) and Ker(A)⋂ Ker(∇) ={ 0}, where A is a bounded
linear operator from L2(Ω) to itself and Ker(A) is the kernel of A. Then (8) has a
unique minimizer g ∈ W1,2(Ω) .

segmentation framework, respectively
The good performance of the SaT approach is solidly backed up. If we set the
parameter λ in (8) to zero, one can show (see Cai and Steidl 2013 and Cai et al.
2019) that the SaT method is equivalent to the famous Chan-Vese segmentation
method (Chan and Vese 2001), which is a simpliﬁed Mumford-Shah model.
Furthermore, numerical experiments show that a properly selected λ can usually
increase segmentation accuracies.
The SaT method is very efﬁcient and ﬂexible. It performs excellently for
degraded images (e.g., noisy and blurry images and images with information loss). It
also has the following advantages. Firstly, the smoothing model with ( 8) is strictly
convex. This guarantees a unique solution of ( 8), which can be solved efﬁciently
by many optimization methods. Secondly, the thresholding step is independent of
the smoothing step. Therefore, the SaT approach is capable of segmentations with
arbitrary phases, and one can easily try different thresholds without recalculating
(8). On the contrary, for other segmentation methods, the number of phases K has
to be determined before the calculation, and it is usually computationally expensive
to regenerate a different segmentation if K changes. Thirdly, the SaT approach is
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1391
Fig. 3 (continued)
1392 X. Cai et al.
very ﬂexible. One can easily modify the smoothing step to better segment images
with speciﬁc properties.
The SaT segmentation methodology has been used for images corrupted by
Poisson and Gamma noises (Chan et al. 2014), degraded color images (Cai et al.
2017), images with intensity inhomogeneity (Chan et al. 2019), hyperspectral
images (Chan et al. 2020), vascular structures (Cai et al. 2011, 2013a), spherical
images (Cai et al. 2020), etc.
SaT-Based Methods and Applications
To exemplify the excellent performance of the SaT segmentation methodology, in
the following, a few methods related to the SaT segmentation methodology with
different applications are introduced.
T-ROF Method
In Cai and Steidl (2013)a n dC a ie ta l .(2019), the thresholded-ROF (T-ROF) method
was proposed. It highlights a relationship between the PCMS model ( 3) and the
ROF model (7), proving that thresholding the minimizer of the ROF model leads to
a partial minimizer of the PCMS model whenK = 2 (Chan-Vese model (4)), which
remains true under speciﬁc assumptions when K> 2.
Theorem 2 (Relation between ROF and PCMS models for K = 2). Let K = 2
and u∗ ∈ BV(Ω) solve the ROF model (7). F or given 0 <m 0 <m 1 ≤ 1,l e t
˜Σ := {x ∈ Ω : u∗(x) > m1+m0
2 } fulﬁll 0 < | ˜Σ | < |Ω |. Then ˜Σ is a minimizer of
the PCMS model (4) for λ := μ
2(m1−m0) and ﬁxed m0,m 1. In particular ,( ˜Σ,m 0,m 1)
is a partial minimizer of (4) if m0 = meanf (Ω \ ˜Σ) and m1 = meanf ( ˜Σ) .
Proof. S e eC a ie ta l .(2019) for the detailed proof.
This linkage between the PCMS model and the ROF model validates the effec-
tiveness of the proposed SaT method in Cai et al. ( 2013b) for image segmentation.
Due to the signiﬁcance of the PCMS model and ROF model, respectively, in image
segmentation and image restoration, this linkage bridges to some extent these
two research areas and might serve as a motivation to improve and design better

methods. A direct beneﬁt is the newly proposed efﬁcient segmentation method –
T-ROF method. The T-ROF method exactly follows the paradigm to perform image
segmentation through image restoration plus iterative thresholding, where these
thresholds are selected automatically following certain rules. This appears to be
more sophisticated than the SaT method (Cai et al. 2013b) which is based on
K-means. It is worth emphasizing that the ROF model and the T-ROF model
both need to be solved once, and the T-ROF method gives optimal segmentation
results akin to the PCMS model. The convergence of the T-ROF method regarding
threshold automatic selection is also proved.
On the one hand, the T-ROF method can be regarded as a special case of the SaT
method. However, it is directly obtained from the linkage between the PCMS model
and the ROF model and thus is more theoretically justiﬁed. Moreover, the strategy
of choosing the thresholds automatically and optimally in the T-ROF method is not
covered in the SaT method in Cai et al. ( 2013b). The strategy makes the T-ROF
method more effective particularly for degraded images whose phases have close
intensities. On the other hand, the T-ROF method inherits the advantages of the SaT
method – fast speed and computational cost independent of the required number
of phases K. In contrast, methods solving the PCMS model become computational
demanding as the required number of phases increases.
To demonstrate the great performance of the T-ROF method, Fig. 4 gives an
example of segmenting a synthetic retina image based on one manually segmented
result from the DRIVE dataset (http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/).
Figures 4a and b are the clean manual segmentation image and the noisy image
generated by adding Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance 0.1. Note that in
Fig. 4a, the original binary manual segmentation image is changed to three phases
by lowering the intensity of those vessels on the right hand side from 1 to 0.3; the
intensities of the background and the vessels on the left hand side are, respectively,
0 and 1. Obviously, segmenting the noisy three-phase image in Fig.4b is extremely
challenging due to those thin blood vessels which have a big chance of being
smoothed out. Figure 4 shows that the T-ROF method together with the SaT method
(Cai et al. 2013b) achieves the best result (with much faster speed compared with
others). For more detail of the T-ROF method, please refer to Cai and Steidl (2013)
and Cai et al. (2019).
Two-Stage Method for Poisson or Gamma Noise
The Poisson noise and the multiplicative Gamma noise are ﬁrstly recalled below.
For the Poisson noise, for each pixel x ∈ Ω , we assume that the intensity f( x)
is a random variable following the Poisson distribution with mean g(x), i.e., its
probability mass function is
pf( x)(n;g(x)) = (g(x))ne−g(x)
n! ,

et al. 2010b;H ee ta l .2012; Cai et al. 2013b) and the T-ROF method (Cai et al.2019), respectively
where n is the intensity off at the pixelx. In this case, we say thatf is corrupted by
Poisson noise. For the Gamma noise, suppose that for each pixelx ∈ Ω the random
variable η(x) follows the Gamma distribution, i.e., its probability density function is
pη(x)(y;θ,K) = 1
θKΓ( K)yK−1e− y
θ for y ≥ 0, (9)
where Γ is the usual Gamma-function and θ and K denote the scale and shape
parameters in the Gamma distribution, respectively. Notice that the mean ofη(x) is
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1395
Kθ and the variance of η(x) is Kθ2. For multiplicative noise, we assume in general
that the mean of η(x) equals 1; see Aubert and Aujol ( 2008) and Durand et al.
(2010). Then we have Kθ = 1 and its variance is 1 /K. We assume the degraded
image is f( x) = g(x) · η(x) and say that f is corrupted by multiplicative Gamma
noise.
The construction of a data ﬁdelity term can be inspired by the following
observations. With the abuse of notation, suppose f is the given image with
noise following a certain statistical distribution, and let p(g|f) be the conditional
probability of g when we have observed f . Then based on maximum a posteriori
approach, restoring the imageg is equivalent to maximizing the probabilityp(g|f) .
Assume the prior distribution of g is given by
p(g) ∝ exp(−β
∫
Ω
|∇g|dx),
where β is a parameter. If the noise follows the Poisson distribution, then maximiz-
ing p(g|f) corresponds to minimizing the functional
∫
Ω
(g − f logg)dx + β
∫
Ω
|∇g|dx (10)
(see Le et al. 2007). If the noise is multiplicative following the Gamma distribution,
then maximizing p(u|f) corresponds to minimizing the functional
∫
Ω
(f
g + logg)dx + β
∫
Ω
|∇g|dx (11)
(see Aubert and Aujol 2008). However, it is observed in the numerical examples in
Aubert and Aujol (2008) and Shi and Osher (2008) that for the denoising model (11)
the noise survives much longer at low image values if we increase the regularization
parameter. Therefore, in Shi and Osher ( 2008), the authors suggested to take w =
log g and change the objective functional (11)t o

In Chan et al. ( 2014), a two-stage method for segmenting blurry images in the
presence of Poisson or multiplicative Gamma noise is proposed. It was inspired by
the SaT segmentation method in Cai et al. (2013b) and the Gamma noise denoising
method in Steidl and Teuber (2010). Speciﬁcally, the data ﬁdelity term of the model

SLaT Method for Color Images
Extending or conceiving segmentation methods for color images is not a simple
task since one needs to discriminate segments with respect to both luminance
and chrominance information. The two-phase Chan-Vese model (Chan and Vese
2001) was generalized to deal with vector-valued images in Chan et al. ( 2000)b y
combining the information in the different channels using the data ﬁdelity term.
Many methods are applied in the usual RGB color space (Cai 2015; Chan et al.
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1397
2000; Cremers et al. 2007; Jung et al. 2007; Kay et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2001;
Pock et al.2009a; Storath and Weinmann2014), among others. It is often mentioned
that the RGB color space is not well adapted to segmentation because for real-world
images the R, G, and B channels can be highly correlated. In Rotaru et al. ( 2008),
RGB images are transformed into HSI (hue, saturation, and intensity) color space
in order to perform segmentation. In Benninghoff and Garcke ( 2014), a general
segmentation approach was developed for gray-value images and further extended
to color images in the RGB, the HSV (hue, saturation, and value), and the CB
(chromaticity-brightness) color spaces. However, a study on this point in Paschos
(2001) has shown that the Lab (perceived lightness, red-green, and yellow-blue)
color space deﬁned by the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) is better
adapted for color image segmentation than the RGB and the HSI color spaces.
In Cardelino et al. ( 2013), RGB input images were ﬁrst converted to Lab space.
In Wang et al. (2015), color features were described using the Lab color space and
texture using histograms in RGB space.
A careful examination of the methods that transform a given RGB image to
another color space (HSI, CB, Lab, etc.) before performing the segmentation task
has shown that these algorithms are always applied only to noise-free RGB images
(though these images unavoidably contain quantization and compression noise). For
instance, this is the case of Benninghoff and Garcke (2014), Cardelino et al. (2013),
Rotaru et al. (2008) and Wang et al. (2015), among others. One of the main reasons
is that if the input RGB image is degraded, the degradation would be hard to control
after a transformation to another color space (Paschos 2001).
A color image is usually represented by a vector valued function f =
(f
1,f 2,f 3) : Ω → R3, where the components f1, f2, and f3 generally
represent red, green, and blue channels, respectively. The difﬁculty for color
image segmentation partly comes from the strong interchannel correlation. A novel
extension of the SaT approach is the smoothing, lifting, and thresholding (SLaT)
method introduced in Cai et al. ( 2017), which is able to work on vector-valued
(color) images possibly corrupted with noise, blur, and missing data. One ﬁrst
solves (8) for the three components f
1, f2, and f3 to obtain three smooth functions
g1, g2, and g3. Then one transforms (g1,g 2,g 3) to another color space (¯g1, ¯g2, ¯g3)
which can reduce interchannel correlation. This is the lifting process, and the
Lab color space is usually a good choice. In the thresholding step, one performs
K-means to threshold the lifted image with 6 channels (g
1,g 2,g 3, ¯g1, ¯g2, ¯g3) to get
the phases.
I nC a ie ta l .(2017), model (8) was also extended to tackle information loss and
both Gaussian and Poisson noises. In particular, the existence and uniqueness of the
extended model with information loss and both Gaussian and Poisson noises was
also proved.
This SLaT method is easy to implement with promising results; see Fig. 6 with
images chosen from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark ( https://
www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) Moreover, the SLaT
method has the ability to segment color images corrupted by noise, blur, or when
some pixel information is lost. More experimental results in Cai et al. ( 2017)o n

three images are degraded by various noise and blur, and the last two images are degraded by 60%
information loss and noise). Second row: Pock et al. ( 2009a). Third row: SLaT method (Cai et al.
2017)
RGB images coupled with Lab secondary color space demonstrate that the method
gives much better segmentation results for images with degradation than some state-
of-the-art segmentation models both in terms of quality and CPU time cost.
Two-Stage Method for Hyperspectral Images
Remotely sensed hyperspectral images are images taken from drones, airplanes,
or satellites that record a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum, typically more
than 100 spectral bands from visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Since different
materials reﬂect different spectral signatures, one can identify the materials at each
pixel of the image by examining its spectral signatures. Hyperspectral images are
used in many applications, including agriculture (Patel et al.2001;D a t te ta l .2003),
disaster relief (Eismann et al. 2009), food safety (Gowen et al. 2007), military
(Manolakis and Shaw 2002; Stein et al. 2002), and mineralogy (Hörig et al. 2001).
One of the most important problems in hyperspectral data exploitation is
hyperspectral image classiﬁcation. It has been an active research topic in past
decades (Fauvel et al. 2013). The pixels in the hyperspectral image are often
labeled manually by experts based on careful review of the spectral signatures and
investigation of the scene. Given these ground-truth labels of some pixels (also
called “training pixels”), the objective of hyperspectral image classiﬁcation is to
assign labels to part or all of the remaining pixels (the “testing pixels”) based on
their spectral signatures and their locations.
In Chan et al. (2020), a two-stage method was proposed based on the SaT method
(Cai et al. 2013b) for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation. Pixel-wise classiﬁers, such
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1399
as the classical support vector machine (SVM), consider spectral information only.
As spatial information is not utilized, the classiﬁcation results are not optimal,
and the classiﬁed image may appear noisy. Many existing methods, such as
morphological proﬁles, superpixel segmentation, and composite kernels, exploit the
spatial information. In Chan et al. ( 2020), a two-stage approach was proposed. In
the ﬁrst stage, SVMs are used to estimate the class probability for each pixel. In
the second stage, the SaT model is applied to each probability map to denoise and
segment the image into different classes. The proposed method effectively utilizes
both spectral and spatial information of the datasets and is fast as only convex
minimization is needed in addition to the SVMs.
We emphasize that the convex model used in Chan et al. ( 2020) is the model
(8) at the ﬁrst stage of the SaT segmentation method in Cai et al. ( 2013b), with a
constraint, i.e.,

where fk represents the probability map of the kth class obtained from stage one
using the SVM method, gk is the improved probability map of the kth class, and
Ω train is the set of training pixels. After obtaininggk,k = 1...,K , individual pixels
will be labeled to a set which possesses the maximum values among gk(x), k =
1...,K . Note that the above stage two performs like the SaT strategy.

Tight-Frame-Based Method for Images with Vascular Structures
The segmentation problem of branching tubular objects in 2D and 3D images
arises in many applications, for example, extracting roads in aerial photography,
and anatomical surfaces of blood vessels in medical images. Identifying tube-like
structures is of great importance in medical imaging, with the primary application
of segmenting blood vessels in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images.
Unlike classical segmentation problems, vessel segmentation is characterized by
different aims such as the following: (a) detect correctly branches and complex
topologies, (b) detect vessels of very different thickness (from very thin to very
thick), (c) repair small occlusions (false disconnections), (d) remove noise incor-
rectly segmented, and (e) control the minimum thickness of the vessels by a
user-given precision. Moreover, when used in a real-time medical environment,
automatic, robust, and efﬁcient methods are essential. All these requirements make
the vessel segmentation problem very challenging.
Many different approaches for image segmentation and, in particular, vessel
segmentation have been proposed in the literature; see, for example, Chapman et al.
(2004), Chen and Amini (2004), Dong et al. (2010), Franchini et al. (2010), Gooya
et al. (2008), Krissian et al. ( 2000), Lorigo et al. ( 2001), Sum and Cheung ( 2008),
Yan and Kassim ( 2006), Zonoobi et al. ( 2009) and the extended reviews Cremers
et al. (2007) and Kirbas and Quek ( 2004). Below we give a brief account of some
of these methods.
I nC a ie ta l .( 2011, 2013a), a tight-frame-based method was proposed to
automatically identify tube-like structures in medical imaging, with the primary
application of segmenting blood vessels in magnetic resonance angiography images.
The method iteratively reﬁnes a region that encloses the potential boundary of the
vessels. At each iteration, the tight-frame algorithm was applied to denoise and
smooth the potential boundary and sharpen the region, in a similar fashion as the
SaT strategy. The cost per iteration is proportional to the number of pixels in the
image. It is proved that the iteration converges in a ﬁnite number of steps to a binary
image whereby the segmentation of the vessels can be done straightforwardly.
Let f = vec(f ) denote the vector obtained by concatenating the columns of f .
It is worth mentioning the tight-frame algorithms used in, e.g., Cai et al. (2008) can
be presented in the following generic form:
f
(i+ 1
2 ) = U (f(i)), (15)
f(i+1) = A T Tλ(A f(i+ 1
2 )), i = 1, 2,.... (16)
Here f(i) is an approximate solution at the ith iteration, U is a problem-dependent
operator, and Tλ(·) is the soft-thresholding operator deﬁned as follows. Given vec-
tors v =[ v1,··· ,vn]T and λ =[ λ1,··· ,λn]T , Tλ(v) ≡[ tλ1(v1),··· ,tλn (vn)]T ,
where
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1401
tλk (vk) ≡
{
sgn(vk)(|vk|− λk), if |vk| > λk,
0, if |vk|≤ λk. (17)
Let P(i+1) be the diagonal matrix where the diagonal entry is 1 if the correspond-
i n gi n d e xi si nΛ(i+1) and 0 otherwise. Then
f(i+1) ≡ (I − P(i+1))f(i+ 1
2 ) + P(i+1)A T Tλ(A f(i+ 1
2 )). (18)
By reordering the entries of the vector f(i+1) into columns, we obtain the image
f (i+1). We remark that the effect of ( 18) is to denoise and smooth the image on
Λ(i+1).
Figures 8 and 9 give examples which show the great performance of the tight-
frame-based method (Cai et al. 2013a) for images with tube-like structures. For
more detail, please refer to Cai et al. (2013a).
Wavelet-Based Segmentation Method for Spherical Images
Spherical images are common in nature, for example, in cosmology (McEwen
et al. 2007b), astrophysics (Schmitt et al. 2012), planetary science (Audet 2014),
Fig. 8 Segmentation of the kidney volume dataset. (a)G i v e nC T Ai m a g e ;(b) CURVES segmen-

geophysics (Simons et al.2011), and neuroscience (Rathi et al.2011), where images
are naturally deﬁned on the sphere. Clearly, images deﬁned on the sphere are
different to Euclidean images in 2D and 3D in terms of symmetries, coordinate
systems, and metrics constructed (see, e.g., Li and Hai 2010).
Wavelets have become a powerful analysis tool for spherical images, due to
their ability to simultaneously extract both spectral and spatial information. A
variety of wavelet frameworks have been constructed on the sphere in recent years,
e.g., Baldi et al. ( 2009), McEwen et al. ( 2018), and have led to many insightful
scientiﬁc studies in the ﬁelds mentioned above (see McEwen et al. 2007b, Schmitt
et al. 2012, Audet 2014, Simons et al. 2011, Rathi et al. 2011). Different types
of wavelets on the sphere have been designed to probe different structures in
spherical images, for example, isotropic or directional and geometrical features,
such as linear or curvilinear structures, to mention a few. Axisymmetric wavelets
(Baldi et al. 2009; Leistedt et al. 2013) are useful for probing spherical images
with isotropic structure, directional wavelets (McEwen et al. 2018) for probing
directional structure, ridgelets (Michailovich and Rathi 2010; Starck et al. 2006)
for analyzing antipodal signals on the sphere, and curvelets (Starck et al. 2006;
Chan et al. 2017) for studying highly anisotropic image content such as curve-
like features (we refer to Candés and Donoho ( 2005) for the general deﬁnition
40 An Overview of SaT Segmentation Methodology and Its Applications. . . 1403
of Euclidean ridgelets and curvelets). Fast algorithms have been developed to
compute exact forward and inverse wavelet transforms on the sphere for very large
spherical images containing millions of pixels (McEwen et al. 2007a). Localization
properties of wavelet constructions have also been studied in detail (McEwen
et al. 2018), showing important quasi-exponential localization and asymptotic
uncorrelation properties for certain wavelet constructions. An investigation into the
use of axisymmetric and directional wavelets for sparse image reconstruction was
performed recently in Wallis et al. (2017), showing excellent performance.
I nC a ie ta l .(2020), a wavelet-based method was proposed to segment images
on the sphere, accounting for the underlying geometry of spherical data. The
method is a direct extension of the tight-frame-based segmentation method (Cai
et al. 2011, 2013a) used to automatically identify tube-like structures such as blood
vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any arbitrary type of wavelet
frame deﬁned on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional wavelets,
curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows the desirable
properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the segmentation process. In
particular, directional wavelets and curvelets, which were designed to efﬁciently
capture directional signal content, provide additional advantages in segmenting
images containing prominent directional and curvilinear features.
Figure 10 gives an example which shows the great performance of the wavelet-
based segmentation method for spherical images. For more detail, please refer to
Cai et al. (2020).
Three-Stage Method for Images with Intensity Inhomogeneity
The intensity inhomogeneity is a common phenomenon in real-world images and
may bring considerable difﬁculties for image segmentation (Li et al. 2008). The
intensity inhomogeneity can be roughly divided into two types: the extrinsic one
and the intrinsic one. The extrinsic intensity inhomogeneity is globally revoked
by the image acquisition devices or illumination variations which frequently
appear in medical images. On the other hand, the intrinsic one is caused by the
local discrepancy of the image color, intensity, or texture pattern in objects and
backgrounds which usually appear in natural images.
The extrinsic inhomogeneous intensities are usually smoothly varying. Involving
the local intensity information in the energy functional is a common way to address
the issue of extrinsic inhomogeneity. Li et al. ( 2008) and Wang et al. ( 2010)u s e d
Gaussian kernel methods to characterize the intensities in local regions. The intrinsic
intensity inhomogeneity varies sharply. Some texture segmentation algorithms (e.g.,
Brox et al. 2010 and Cremers et al. 2007) have been proposed to tackle such kinds
of intensity inhomogeneity. New features (e.g., structure tensors (Ge et al. 2015),
salient information (Kim and Kim 2013)) were also designed to get the desired
segmentation results. Zhi and Shen ( 2018) proposed a level set-based method by
incorporating saliency information and image intensity as region external energy to
1404 X. Cai et al.

the sphere ( a) and in 2D using a Mollweide projection ( b) and the zoomed-in red rectangle

WSSA-H (h), respectively. Note that methods WSSA-A, WSSA-D, and WSSA-H are the wavelet-
based segmentation method (Cai et al. 2020), respectively, equipped with axisymmetric wavelets,
directional wavelets, and hybrid wavelets deﬁned on the sphere
motivate the curve evolution. These models can handle the intensity inhomogeneity
to some extent.
In Li et al. ( 2020), a new three-stage segmentation framework was proposed
based on the SaT method and the intensity inhomogeneity information of an image.
The ﬁrst stage in this framework is to perform a dimension lifting method. An
intensity inhomogeneity image is added as an additional channel, which results in
a vector-valued image. In the second stage, a SaT model is applied to each channel
of the vector-valued image to obtain a smooth approximation. The semi-proximal
alternating direction method of multipliers (sPADMM) (Han et al. 2018)i su s e dt o

Li et al. (2010, 2020), Zhi and Shen (2018), Wang et al. (2009) and the ground truth
solve this model, and it is proved that the sPADMM for solving this convex model
has Q-linear convergence rate. In the last stage, a thresholding method is applied to
the smoothed vector-valued image to get the ﬁnal segmentation.
Figure 11 shows the great performance of the three-stage method (Li et al.2020)
incorporating intensity inhomogeneity information, and Fig. 12 demonstrates that
Li et al. (2020) provides the most accurate segmentation results in comparison with
ﬁve state-of-the-art methods including a deep learning approach (U-net method)
(Ronneberger et al. 2015). For more detail, please refer to Li et al. (2020).
Conclusions
In this article, we introduced the SaT (smoothing and thresholding) segmentation
methodology and methods developed based on this methodology with many
applications in image processing. The SaT method provides an efﬁcient and ﬂexible
methodology for image segmentations. It is easy to adapt the SaT method for
1406 X. Cai et al.

various segmentation tasks. The SaT approach connects the segmentation problem
to image restoration problem. Recent researches show that the SaT method can also
be applied to classiﬁcation problems. We hope that, with this article, the SaT method
can reach audiences from broader areas and can inspire more cross-disciplinary
researches.

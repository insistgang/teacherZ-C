A Two-Stage Image Segmentation Method Using a Convex Variant of the
Mumford–Shah Model and Thresholding ∗
Xiaohao Cai †, Raymond Chan †, and Tieyong Zeng ‡
Abstract. The Mumford–Shah model is one of the most important image segmentation models and has been
studied extensively in the last twenty years. In this paper, we propose a two-stage segmentation
method based on the Mumford–Shah model. The ﬁrst stage of our method is to ﬁnd a smooth
solution g to a convex variant of the Mumford–Shah model. Onceg is obtained, then in the second
stage the segmentation is done by thresholding g into diﬀerent phases. The thresholds can be
given by the users or can be obtained automatically using any clustering methods. Because of the
convexity of the model,g can be solved eﬃciently by techniques like the split-Bregman algorithm
or the Chambolle–Pock method. We prove that our method is convergent and that the solutiong
is always unique. In our method, there is no need to specify the number of segmentsK (K ≥2)
before ﬁnding g. We can obtain anyK-phase segmentations by choosing (K −1) thresholds afterg
is found in the ﬁrst stage, and in the second stage there is no need to recomputeg if the thresholds
are changed to reveal diﬀerent segmentation features in the image. Experimental results show that
our two-stage method performs better than many standard two-phase or multiphase segmentation
methods for very general images, including antimass, tubular, MRI, noisy, and blurry images.

1. Introduction. Let Ω⊂ R2 be a bounded open connected set, Γ be a compact curve
in Ω, andf :Ω → R be a given image. Without loss of generality, we restrict the range
of f to [0,1], and hence f ∈L∞(Ω). In [42, 43], Mumford and Shah proposed an energy
minimization problem which approximates the true solution by ﬁnding optimal piecewise
smooth approximations. More precisely, the energy minimization problem was formulated in

1-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure inR2;s e e[4]. Because model (1.1) is nonconvex, it is very
challenging to ﬁnd or approximate its minimizer.

SEGMENTATION BY CONVEX MUMFORD–SHAH MODEL 369
In [1, 2], the Mumford–Shah energy (1.1) was approximated by a sequence of simpler
elliptic variational problems where the length of Γ was replaced by a phase ﬁeld energy.
Later, nonlocal approximation of (1.1) was proposed in [11, 12, 25, 41]. By using a family of
continuousandnondecreasingfunctions,they avoid computingΓexplicitly. Inparticular, their
methods solve an anisotropic variant of the Mumford–Shah model (1.1). In [10], numerical
approaches based on a discrete functional were considered for solving (1.1). Recently, a novel
primal-dual algorithm based on a convex representation of (1.1) was proposed. It can solve
(1.1) accurately. However, for a 128× 128 image, it requires 600 seconds on a Tesla C1060
GPU machine. Until now, the bottleneck of solving (1.1) has still been that the model itself
is nonconvex.
Over the years, people have tried to simplify the model (1.1). For example, if we restrict
∇g ≡0o nΩ\Γ, then it results in a piecewise constant Mumford–Shah model. In [16], the
method of active contours without edges (Chan–Vese model) was introduced. It solves the
piecewise constant Mumford–Shah model but restricts the solution to be a piecewise constant
solution with only two constants. For works on the general piecewise constant Mumford–
Shah model, see [31, 49, 50], etc. These methods work well for certain image segmentation
tasks, for example for cartoon images. However, the main drawback of these methods is
that they can easily get stuck in local minima. In order to overcome the problem, convex
relaxation approaches [7, 14, 45] and the graph cut method [27] were proposed. There are
also many other models related to the Chan–Vese model [16, 49], for example, the two-
phase segmentation algorithms in [19, 52, 53] and multiphase segmentation algorithms in
[3, 8, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 47, 48, 54]. Speciﬁcally, in [33], the piecewise constant Mumford–Shah
model was convexiﬁed by using fuzzy membership functions. In [47], a new regularization term
was introduced which allows choosing the number of phases automatically. In [52, 53, 54],
eﬃcient methods based on the fast continuous max-ﬂow method were proposed. In [19], the
length term was replaced by a term involving framelets. In [32], the continuous multiclass
labeling approaches were discussed. Interested readers can read the references therein or see
[4] for more details.
In this paper, we separate the task of segmentation into two stages. The ﬁrst stage
is to ﬁnd a smooth image g that can facilitate the segmentation, and the second stage is
to threshold g to reveal diﬀerent segmentation features. To ﬁndg, instead of tackling the
challenging problem of solving the Mumford–Shah model (1.1), we propose to use the model

where A can be the identity operator (for noisy observed imagef) or a blurring operator (if
there are noise and blur inf). We will see that our model (1.2) is closely related to (1.1)a n d
is convex with a unique smooth solution. In the ﬁrst stage of our two-stage method, we solve
(1.2). Onceg is found, then in the second stage, the segmentation is obtained by segmentingg
using properly chosen threshold(s). To segmentg into K segments, K ≥2, we require (K−1)
thresholds which the users can provide themselves or obtain automatically by any clustering
methods such as the K-means methods [28, 38] or the convex K-means method named SON
clustering [36]. Figure 1 shows two multiphase segmentation results from our method using
thresholds from Matlab K-mean command kmeans on g.

(a) Given image. (b) Three phases. (c) Given image. (d) Four phases.
Figure 1. Multiphase segmentation results given by our method.
We will prove that, under mild conditions, our model (1.2) has one and only one solutiong
which can be solved very quickly by popular algorithms such as the split-Bregman algorithm
[26] or the Chambolle–Pock method [13, 44]. One nice aspect of our method is that there
is no need to recomputeg if we have to change the thresholds in the second stage to reveal
diﬀerent features in the image. Another nice aspect is that there is no need to specifyK in
the ﬁrst stage, i.e., before ﬁndingg. We can obtain anyK-phase segmentation (K ≥2) by
choosing (K −1) thresholds afterg is computed in the ﬁrst stage. In contrast, multiphase
methods such as those in [3, 8, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 45, 48, 54]r e q u i r eK to be given ﬁrst; and,
if K changes, the minimization problem has to be solved again.
Our tests in section4 show that our method can segment diﬀerent kinds of images: anti-
mass image, tubular MRA image, brain MRI image, image with very high noise, and image
with blur and noise. For the blur and noisy image, all the multiphase methods we tested
[33, 47, 54, 3, 45] fail, while our method can provide a very good result; see Figures1(c)–(d)
or 10. We will see that our method is fast compared to popular two-phase segmentation
methods [16, 19, 53] and multiphase segmentation methods [33, 47, 54, 3, 45].
Note that onceg is obtained and the thresholds are given, the segmenting ofg into K
segments requires very little time. In fact, the complexity is proportional to the number of
pixels in the image. Hence our method is quite suitable for users to play around with diﬀerent
thresholds to determine the number of segments they prefer and to reveal the diﬀerent features
within the image. However, we can also use theMatlab-provided K-means method to com-
pute the thresholds automatically for users who prefer an automatedK-phase segmentation
algorithm.
Our model provides a better understanding of the link between image segmentation and
image restoration. Indeed, the eﬀectiveness of our method suggests that for segmentation a
key idea is to extract the cartoon part in the image, i.e.,g, and then clusterg into diﬀerent
phases. Based on this two-stage idea, it is likely that more eﬃcient segmentation methods
can be developed in the future along this line. As pointed out by one of the reviewers,
Esedo¯glu and Tsai also proposed a two-stage approach in [21]—one that also uses smoothing
followed by thresholding. Indeed, [21] proposed an extremely eﬃcient PDE-based algorithm
for minimizing the piecewise constant Mumford–Shah segmentation model. Their algorithm
was inspired by the work of Merriman, Bence, and Osher (MBO) on diﬀusion generated
motion by curvature [39, 40]. Similar to the MBO algorithm, each iteration of [21]r e q u i r e sa
solution of a linear diﬀusion equation and then a thresholding. The main diﬀerence between
our method and the approach in [21]i sc l e a r :i n[21], the smoothing and thresholding are

done alternatively for a number of iterations, while in our two-stage method, the smoothing
and the thresholding are done only once: smoothing in the ﬁrst stage and thresholding in the
second stage. For more details along the direction of smoothing and ﬁltering, see [21, 39, 40]
and references therein.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section2, we derive our convex model
(1.2) which is based on the Mumford–Shah model. We then show that our model has a unique
solution. In section3, we give the detailed implementation of our method and show that the
resulting algorithm converges. In section4, we compare our method on various synthetic and
real images with three two-phase segmentation algorithms [19, 16, 53] and ﬁve multiphase
segmentation methods [33, 47, 54, 3, 45]. The relationship between our model and models in
image restoration is discussed in section5. Conclusions are given in section6.
2. Two-stage method. Our model is motivated by the following simple but important
observation aboutbinaryimages: abinaryimage can berecovered quitewell from itssmoothed
version by thresholding with a proper threshold. Figure2 is an example to illustrate our point.
Figure 2(a) is the true binary image, and2(b) is its smoothed version obtained by a Gaussian
ﬁlter with size [5,5] and standard deviation 3. Obviously, pixel values near the boundary are
smoothed. However, by using a threshold of 0.5 to threshold Figure2(b) back to a binary
image, we obtain Figure2(c). We see that all the pixels of Figure2(a) except some on the
boundary are correctly recovered; see the diﬀerence image in Figure2(d). Inspired by this
idea, we will modify model (1.1) step by step to arrive at our model (1.2). Brieﬂy, our method
consists of two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we will ﬁnd the smooth minimizer of (1.2); then in
the second stage, we apply a simple thresholding strategy to carry out the segmentation. In
the following, we derive our model (1.2).

}
.
For the deﬁnition of W1,2(Ω), see [22, Chapter 5]. The existence and uniqueness of the
solutions g1 and g2 are guaranteed by the following proposition.
Proposition 2.1. Let f ∈L2(Ω). Then the two minimization problems (2.2) and (2.3) have
unique minimizers.
Proof. Since Σ is closed, both the sets Ω\Σa n dΣ\Γ are open. Using the conclusions of
Proposition 1 in [4]o rP r o p o s i t i o n3i n[18], we conclude that problems (2.2)a n d(2.3)h a v e
unique minimizers.
From the analysis above we can conclude that once the boundary Γ is ﬁxed, i.e., Σ is
ﬁxed, then g1 and g2 are determined uniquely. Note that in [14], the Chan–Vese model is
made convex once the mean values off inside and outside of Γ are ﬁxed. Here, motivated by
Theorem 2 of [14], we can derive and prove the following similar theorem for the model (2.1)
once g1 and g2 are ﬁxed and smoothly extended to the whole Ω.
Theorem 2.2. For any given ﬁxed functions g1 and g2 ∈W1,2(Ω), a global minimizer for
˜E(Σ,g1,g2) in (2.1) can be found by carrying out the following convex minimization,
(2.4) min

}
,
and setting Σ= {x : u(x) ≥ρ} for almost every ρ∈[0,1].
Proof. See AppendixA.
From Theorem2.2, we see that the term Per(Σ) of (2.1) is replaced by a convex integral
term
∫
Ω|∇u|. In other words, the boundary information of Γ in (1.1) can be extracted
from the TV (total variation) term
∫
Ω|∇u|. This motivates us to use
∫
Ω|∇g| to extract the
boundary information Length(Γ) in (1.1). Evidently, this approximation is also related to the
fuzzy membership approach [7, 14, 33] to handle the Chan–Vese model. In the following, we
therefore use
∫
Ω|∇g| to approximate the boundary term (the last term) in the Mumford–Shah
energy (1.1).
Next we consider simplifying the middle term in model (1.1). In (1.1), the solution is
restricted to be a smooth function in Ω\Σa n di nΣ\Γ. However, from the example given in
Figure 2, we see that these smooth parts can be recovered quite well from a smooth function
g in Ω by a proper thresholding. Therefore in the following, we look for solutiong ∈W1,2(Ω).
Then we have the next result.
Lemma 2.3. If g ∈W1,2(Ω) and Γis a closed curve with m(Γ) = 0,w h e r em(·) is the
Lebesgue measure, then
∫
Γ|∇g|2dx =0 .
Proof. Sinceg ∈W1,2(Ω), we have∇g ∈L2(Ω). Because ofm(Γ) = 0, we get
∫
Γ|∇g|2dx =
0 immediately.

,
where λand μare positive parameters. Since sometimes the given image is degraded by noise
and blur, we extend this model to general cases by introducing a problem-related operatorA
in its ﬁdelity term. Then, ﬁnally, our model is

,
where A may stand for the identity operator or a blurring operator. Obviously, ifμ̸=0i n
(2.6), g will be smooth. The following theorem shows the existence and uniqueness ofg.
Theorem 2.4. Let Ωbe a bounded connected open subset of R2 with a Lipschitz boundary.
Let f ∈L2(Ω)and Ker(A) ⋂Ker(∇)= {0},w h e r eA is a bounded linear operator from L2(Ω)
to itself and Ker(A) is the kernel of A.T h e n (2.6) has a unique minimizer g ∈W1,2(Ω).
Proof. See AppendixB.
We remark that the condition Ker(A) ⋂Ker(∇)= {0} actually restrictsA1 ̸=0 .I tm e a n s
that Af ̸=0i f f is a nonzero constant image. The condition holds for all blurring operators,
as they are convolution operators with positive kernels.
We emphasize that model (2.6) can be minimized quickly by using currently available
eﬃcient algorithms such as the split-Bregman algorithm [26] or the Chambolle–Pock method
[13, 44]. Once g is obtained, we enter into the second stage of our method, where we use
thresholding to segmentg into diﬀerent phases. The thresholds can be determined by any
clustering methods or be chosen by the users. We leave the implementation to section3.
3. Numerical aspects. In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the split-Bregman algorithm
for solving our model (2.6). After that we give a strategy based on the K-means method to
determine the thresholds automatically.

the ﬁrst row ofg. Similarly, we can deﬁne∇y.A s( 3.1) is convex, it can be solved by many
methods such as the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is convergent and is
well suited to distributed convex optimization; see [5, 23] and references therein. Speciﬁcally,
its variant, the split-Bregman algorithm [26], is used widely to solve a very broad class of
L

provides a convergence rate. In the following, we derive the split-Bregman algorithm for
solving (3.1). Clearly the algorithm converges, since our model (3.1) is a convex regularization
problem; see [5, 23, 26] for more details of the convergence analysis.

3.2. Determining the thre sholds in the second stage. As mentioned before, our seg-
mentation result is obtained by thresholding the solutiong of (3.1) with proper threshold(s)
ρ. For example, for two-phase segmentation, one may chooseρto be the mean value ofg,a n d
then use thisρto thresholdg into two phases. Or the user can try diﬀerent values ofρto get
the best result. Note thatthere is no need to recompute the image g when we change ρ. We
just threshold the imageg with the newρto get a new binary image.
In case one wants to choose the thresholds automatically, here we discuss how to choose
them using clustering methods. There are many clustering methods, including the K-means
methods [28, 30, 38] and the convex K-means method named SON clustering [36]. To stan-
dardize the discussions, we begin by normalizing the pixel values ofg to [0,1]. We do this by
using the linear-stretch formula:
(3.8) ¯ g = g −g
min
gmax −gmin
,
where gmax and gmin represent maximum and minimum ofg, respectively.
I nt h ef o l l o w i n g ,w eu s et h eMatlab K-means command kmeans as an example to in-
troduce our strategy of choosing the thresholds automatically. The K-means method is a
very eﬃcient method for classifying a given set intoK clusters, withK speciﬁed in advance.
Suppose we want to segment ¯g into K segments, K ≥2. We use the K-means method to
classify the set of pixel values of ¯g into K clusters. Let the mean value of each cluster be
ˆρ
1, ˆρ2,..., ˆρK, and without loss of generality, let ˆρ1 ≤ ˆρ2 ≤··· ≤ ˆρK. Then we deﬁne the
(K −1) thresholds as

then we invoke the commandcontour in Matlab. Again we emphasize that if we change
the value ofK or the thresholds, there isno need to recompute g and ¯g.
4. Experimental results. In this section, we compare our segmentation model (3.1)w i t h
three two-phase segmentation methods proposed in [16, 19, 53] and ﬁve multiphase segmen-
tation methods proposed in [33, 47, 54, 3, 45]. Methods [16]a n d[19]u s eT Va n df r a m e l e t
regularization terms, respectively; therefore, we can compare the performance of these two
diﬀerent regularization approaches with ours. Methods [19, 53, 33, 47, 54, 3, 45] are eﬀective
segmentation methods all published in or after 2009. The codes we used are provided by
the authors. Apart from some default settings, like the maximum number of iterations, the
parameters in the codes are chosen by trial and error to give the best results of the respective
methods.
For two-phase segmentation, we useρ
M, ρ1,a n dρU to denote the thresholds we used in
the tests. They represent respectively the mean of the normalized image ¯g given in (3.8), the
threshold obtained by K-means given in (3.9), and a threshold chosen by us, the user. For
multiphase segmentation, we tried the thresholdsρi, obtained by K-means in (3.9), andρU
i ,
chosen by us. The toleranceϵ and the step sizeσused in the split-Bregman algorithm in (3.2)
were ﬁxed to be 10−4 and 2, respectively. The parametersλ, μare chosen empirically. All the
results were tested on a MacBook with 2.4 GHz processor and 4GB RAM. The boundaries of
all the results are shown with color and superimposed on the given images.
4.1. Two-phase segmentation.
Example 1: Antimass image. Figure 3(a) is the given image. Figures3(b)–(d) are the re-
sults of methods [16, 19, 53], respectively. Figure3(e) is our smooth solutiong from Algorithm
1 using parametersλ=3a n dμ=1 ;s e e(3.1). Figures 3(f)–(i) are the segmentation results
on the normalized ¯g (see (3.8)) with thresholdsρ
M =0 .1898, ρ1 =0 .2669, andρU =0 .1,0.2,
respectively. Note thatρM and ρ1 are computed automatically. From the results, we see that
our method can reveal diﬀerent meaningful features in the image by choosing diﬀerentρ’s;
this can be done without recomputingg. In contrast, for the methods of [16, 19, 53], one will
need to solve the minimization models again if one wants to reveal diﬀerent features in the
image.
Example 2: Tubular image. Figure 4(a) is a given magnetic resonance angiography kidney
image [24]. The boundaries of the vessels are blurry and vague, so that they are hard to
detect. Figure 4(e) is the solutiong from Algorithm 1 usingλ=2 0a n dμ=1 .F i g u r e s4(f)–
(h) are our segmentation results with thresholdsρ
M =0 .1760, ρ1 =0 .4019, and ρU =0 .2,
respectively. By comparing our results with the results from methods [16, 19, 53]i nF i g u r e s
4(b)–(d), we see that our method can better detect and connect the blood vessels. Recently,
we proposed a tight-frame method speciﬁcally for segmenting vessels [9]. Here we give the
result of that method in Figure4(i), and we see that it is comparable to our method.
Example 3: Image with high noise. In Figures5(a) and (b), we give the clean and the noisy
images, respectively. The noise we added is high: Gaussian noise with mean 0.6 and variance
0.25. Figures5(c)–(e) give the results of methods [16, 19, 53], respectively, on the noisy image.
We see that method [19], which uses tight-frame regularization, recovers these objects better
than method [16], which uses TV regularization, and that method [53] fails completely. Figure
5(f) is our solutiong when λ=4a n dμ=1 .F i g u r e s5(g)–(i) are the segmentation results

with thresholds ρM =0 .8308, ρ1 =0 .6371, and ρU =0 .7 respectively. Clearly, our results
are all good and comparable to the method in [19], i.e., Figure5(d). However, our method is
much faster (see Table1). Notice that the diﬀerences between our results (g)–(i) are small,
indicating that our method is robust with respect to the threshold.
Example 4: Blurry and noisy image. To illustrate the robustness of our method with
respect to the threshold, we tested our method on two blurry images: Figure6 with motion

15. For both images, we added a Gaussian noise with mean 10−3 and variance 2× 10−3.
Figures 6(f) and7(f) are our solutionsg obtained by usingλ= 100 andμ=1 .F r o mF i g u r e s
6(c)–(e) and7(c)–(e), we see that all of the results of methods [16, 19, 53] are not good. More
precisely, methods [16, 19] give incorrect boundaries (linking the ring and the horseshoe object
together), while method [53] misses a large portion of the objects. In contrast, our boundary
recovers the shapes of the objects very well; see Figures6(g)–(i) and7(g)–(i).
Table1 gives the CPU time comparison of the methods. We see that our method is second
only to the two-phase continuous max-ﬂow method in [53]. But from Examples 1–4, we see
that our method gives much better segmentation results than the method in [53]. We remark
that for the examples we tested, the framelet method in [19] did not converge within the
maximum number of iterations (300) using the given tolerance 10−3 speciﬁed in the code.

representation of the three phases by using the mean value of each phase to represent that

separates the cloud in the lower right corner into two parts, and of method [3] (Figure8(e)),
which misses a large part of the cloud. We emphasize that for our method, we do not need to

that our method gives better segmentation. In fact, our model is based on the Mumford–Shah
model (1.1), which admits more high-order information. But methods [53, 54] are basically
using constants to approximate regions. This may explain why they fail in Figures5(e), 8(d),
and 11(d) and give poor results in other examples.
5. Relationship with image restoration. It is interesting to note that our model (2.6)
itself can be regarded as an image restoration model to capture the cartoon part in the image
and is closely related to the classical Rudin–Osher–Fatemi (ROF) image restoration model:

properties of the ROF model is that it can preserve important edge information, but the
staircase eﬀect may be introduced. In order to avoid this, many works have been proposed;

grow as the functionals became more and more complex.
In contrast, in our model (2.6), the staircase eﬀect is reduced because of the middle term
which contains the square of the ﬁrst-order derivative and no other higher-order derivatives.
Oncethe smooth solutiong is found,asuitablethresholdingthengives theimage segmentation
result. From the analysis of section 2 and the numerical results in section4,w es e et h a t
the smoothness in g does not aﬀect the segmentation signiﬁcantly. Nonetheless, it will be
interesting to replace our model (2.6)u s e di nt h eﬁ r s ts t a g eo fo u rm e t h o db yi m p r o v e dT V
models such as (5.2)i n[15]. We leave this project to the future.
6. Conclusions. In this paper, we have proposed a two-stage method for segmentation
that makes use of aconvexmodel (2.6) based on the Mumford–Shah model. In the ﬁrst stage,
our method ﬁnds the unique smooth minimizer by the split-Bregman algorithm [26]. Then
in the second stage, it uses a thresholding strategy to segment the image. Since our model
(2.6) can be regarded as an image restoration model, our method uniﬁes the image processing
works of image segmentation and image restoration. Furthermore, our method combines the
two-phase and multiphase segmentation into one single algorithm. In fact, one does not have
to specify the number of phases before ﬁnding the solution to the model. One can segment the
solution into diﬀerent phases by choosing proper thresholds after the solution is obtained in
the ﬁrst stage. We have introduced a K-means method to choose the thresholds automatically.
The experimental results show that our method is very eﬀective and robust for many kinds
of images, such as antimass, tubular, MRI, noisy, or blurry images.

where ˜E(Σ(ρ),g1,g2) is given in (2.1). Hence, if u(x) is a minimizer of the convex problem
in (A.1), then the set Σ(ρ) has to be the minimizer of the energy˜E(·,g1,g2) for almost every
ρ∈[0,1].
Appendix B. Proof of Theorem 2.4. Recall thatE(g) is deﬁned in (2.6). First we prove
that 0≤infg E(g) < ∞. Indeed, the left-hand side is obvious. Moreover, if we chooseg0 =0 ,
we get

Existence: Note thatW1,2(Ω) is a reﬂective Banach space, andE(g)i sc o n v e xa n dl o w e r

In order to prove thatE(g)i sc o e r c i v eo v e rW1,2(Ω), we just have to prove that∥g∥L2(Ω) can
also be bounded by
√
E(g). Using the Poincar´e inequality onW1,2(Ω) (see [22]), we have
(B.1) ∥g −gΩ∥L2(Ω)≤CΩ∥∇g∥L2(Ω)≤CΩ

∥g∥L2(Ω)≤∥gΩ∥2 +∥g −gΩ∥2,

Uniqueness: We borrow the idea in [55]. Suppose thatg∗
1 and g∗
2 are both minimizers of

(B.3) θE∗(g∗
1)+(1 −θ)E(g∗
2)= E(θg∗
1 +(1 −θ)g∗
2).
Note that each term ofE(g)i n( 2.6) is convex; especially, the ﬁrst two terms ofE(g)a r e
strictly convex with respect toAg and ∇g, respectively. Therefore (B.3)i m p l i e st h a tt h e
